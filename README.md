# Aragon Labs 

Aragon Labs is a research and development initiative funded by the Aragon Foundation to explore governance use cases, develop testable implementations, and drive adoption of decentralized organization structures. 

This repository is used for organization and collaboration on projects under the Aragon Labs umbrella, in some cases we may also use it actively for governance experiments and community engagement. 

Resources will be allocated to proposals based on community support, measured through token based signals and active collaboration with other community governed projects. 

## Getting Started

We encourage community participation and discussion. Here is how you can get involved:

1. Submit and discuss Aragon Labs proposals
2. Participate in community engagement and governance experiments
3. Contribute to development of Aragon Labs projects

### Submission
Anyone may submit an Aragon Labs Proposal draft. To do so create an issue using [the proposal template](https://github.com/aragon/labs/blob/master/proposal-template.md). 

Once submitted they can be reviewed and discussed by the community. The following status values will be used by the Aragon Labs team to help organize proposals. 

- **Draft** : This label will be used to indicate a proposal is in the draft stage. It has been submitted, but has not been formally accepted or prioritized. 
- **Accepted** : This label will be used to indicate when a draft has sufficient information to be considered an actionable proposal. 
- **Active** : This label will be used to indicate when a proposal is under active development. Active proposals will be listed on the Aragon Labs repo home page, along with links to the repos where development is occurring. 
-  **Deferred** : This label will be used to indicate when a previously active proposal is no longer under active development. This could be due to a blocking issue uncovered during development, or due to a shift in community interest. 
- **Completed** : This label will be added for proposals which have been successfully completed. The issue will then be closed. 

### Experiments

A core goal of Aragon Labs is to develop and test different governance mechanisms. In order to test mechanisms in realistic but safe ways, we will be deploying these mechanisms in limited ways. In some cases we will incentivize participation, so be sure to follow @aragonproject or keep an eye on this page for details.  

#### Active Experiments

There are currently no active experiments. Stay tuned!
